// lifecycle in class based component
// it means it is a process of executing the methods
// React hooks in functional based components ie useEffect
// also known as side-effects
// in class based component we can't use any react hook ie useRef useState useEffect etc we have lifecycle method here
// componentDidMount() is same as useEffect:- the very first time this method will get invoked after the return statement executes
// componentDidUpdate() :-it will get triggered whenever a state value is getting updated
// componentWillUnmount():- it will get triggered when i am removing any products from the shopping...
